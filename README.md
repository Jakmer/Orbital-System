# Orbital Gravity

This code uses **Newton's theory of gravitation** 

    F_g = G * m_1 * m_2 / r ^ 2

Where G is Gravity Constant, m is mass of object, r is distance between objects.

The program uses the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for graphical rendering and Eigen for mathematical calculations.
